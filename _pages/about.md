Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), UIUC, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/). Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), Fudan University, under the valued supervision of [Professor Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/).
My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and optimization. Currently, I am particularly interested in designing practical algorithms for modern machine learning (e.g., training large language models) and exploring valid explanations for the effectiveness of practical algorithms.

In my spare time, I love to play badminton and go swimming. I also love to play Go, which is an ancient strategy board game. The picture here was taken when I was playing it.

You can find my CV [here](../files/Yuxing_Liu_CV.pdf).
