Hi! I am an undergraduate student from [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), Fudan University. My research interest lies in machine learning theory and optimization. I am currently interested in theoretical explanations for practical algorithms and efficient algorithm design. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to work closely with Professors [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) and [Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/). 

In my spare time, I love to play badminton and go swimming. I also love to play Go, which is an ancient strategy board game. The picture here was taken when I was playing it.

You can find my CV [here](../files/Yuxing LIU.pdf).
