Hi! I am an undergraduate student from [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), Fudan University. My research interest lies in machine learning theory and optimization. To be more specific, I am currently interested in designing efficient distributed learning algorithms and practical schedules for SGD and SGD with momentum. I am fortunate to be advised by professor [Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/).

In my spare time, I love to play badminton and go swimming. I love to play Go as well, which is an ancient strategy board game. The picture here is photoed when I was playing it.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/Yuxing LIU.pdf).
