Hi! I am an undergraduate student from School of Data Science, Fudan University. My research interest lies in machine learning theory and optimization. To be more specific, I am extremely interested in designing efficient distributed learning algorithms and practical schedules for SGD and SGD with momentum currently. I am very fortunate to be advised by professor [Luo Luo](https://luoluo-sds.github.io/).

In my spare time, I love to paly badminton and go swimming. I love to play Go as well, which is an ancient strategy board game. The picture here is photoed when I was playing it.

You can find my CV [here].
